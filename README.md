# Market-Segmentation-Project with SAS

## Data - 
The NCS survery data is under NDA and can not be shared. The data groups customers based on their responses to questions. The questions vary from demographics,
lifestyle choices, political vies, etc....

## Objective
The objective is to :

1. analyze the dataset and
2. define customer segments based on demographics, attitudes towards other products, the enviroment, and technology. 

## Project Structure

* Data Exploration - Checking frequencies
* PCA Extraction
* K-Means to produce Pesuedo-f, RSquared, and Cubic Clustering Criterion (CCC).

# RESULTS
The cluster means were created based on the following criteria: 

* Important To Look Attractive 
* Exercise Every Week
* Always Look For Brand Name
* Interested in Cell Ads
* Lifestyle Abstract ( use of the internet )
* Enviroment Abstract ( care about the enviroment )
* Timberland Footwear
* UGG
* Converse
* Race 
* Gender 
* Residence 
* Is a Parent

Cluster 1: ( Gym Rats ) Excercise the most and not Interested in Cell Ads. This cluster has the Lowest Timberland Score but moderate scores for competing brands. 
Mainly white cluster. 

Cluster 2: ( Fit Diverse and Tech Aquainted )Excercise quite a bit, but not as much as cluster 1. Tied for 1st when it comes to looking for brand names. 
Are much more interested in cell ads than other groups and have a high score for the lifestyle abstract. 
This cluster has more Timberland, UGG, and much higher Converse buyers than the others.
Has a higher amount of non white survey takers and less parents than other groups.

Cluster 3: (Beautiful Internet Explorers) Cares the most about looks but does not excercise.Looks for brand names but does not care much for cell ads. 
They also have a moderatly high lifestyle abstract score. Low amount of UGG shoppers, leans white, majority female, 2nd highest non parents.  

Cluster 4: (Mature Greens) They care the least about looks, and don't care much for exercise either. They are tied for first in looking for brand names. 
Have a low score for lifestyle, and high score for enviroment. Low score for UGG , but moderate score for Timberland and Converse comparatively. 
The race leans towards non white. Gender is split even. This cluster has the highest score for residence (people with who live in a house or mobile home ).

#### Note: 
There are a few flaws with the way the variables have been created. It would have been best to create mean score for each race and other varirables that
have more than 2 options. This way we could have seen the way sepcific races are being spread across. Sadly, I do not have access to the data this project was created
with anymore, so I can no longer make fixes. Otherwise I would have made improvements.
